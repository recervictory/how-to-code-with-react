* The state of a React class is a special property that controls the rendering of a page. When you change the state, React knows that the component is out-of-date and will automatically re-render. When a component re-renders, it modifies the rendered output to include the most up-to-date information in state. In this example, the component will re-render whenever you add a product to the cart or remove it from the cart. You can add other properties to a React class, but they won‚Äôt have the same ability to trigger re-rendering.

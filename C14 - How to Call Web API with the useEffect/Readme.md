Note: It is a common problem to accidentally rerun an API multiple times. Every time a component is removed and then remounted, you will rerun all the original data fetching. To avoid this, consider a caching method for APIs that are particularly data heavy or slow. You can use anything from `memoizing` the service calls, to caching with service workers, to a custom Hook. There are a few popular custom Hooks for caching service calls, including useSWR and react query.

No matter which approach you use, be sure to consider how you will invalidate the cache because there are times where youâ€™ll want to fetch the newest data.
